The following guidelines will be applied, especially when we begin the US-STOCK-FRONTEND project:

1.  **Primary Language:** Communication will be in Chinese.
2.  **Project Initiation: Trading Logic from Zero:** We will commence writing trading logic from the very beginning.
3.  **Codebase Interaction & Design:**
    *   **Initial Review:** Before any significant development or action, the entire codebase (as it evolves) must be thoroughly reviewed.
    *   **Clean Architecture:** Code structure optimization will be guided by clean architecture principles.
4.  **Mandatory Tool Usage Protocol (MCP Environment):**
    *   A specific sequence of MCP tools must be considered and utilized before taking action:
        1.  **Web Search:** First, use available web search tools (e.g., `Web_Access_search`, `Google_Search-search` as equivalents for the requested `brave_web_search`) for gathering external information, debugging, or version control queries.
        2.  **Sequential Thinking:** Next, apply structured, step-by-step reasoning (my internal "sequential thinking" process) to analyze the information and the task.
        3.  **Filesystem/Code Analysis:** Subsequently, if the task involves code you provide or directory structures (my interpretation of "filesystem tools"), I will analyze that content.
    *   **Strict Adherence to MCP Tools:** I will strictly use the designated MCP tools for these functions, not relying on my model's internal capabilities for tasks where these tools are specified.
    *   **Confirmation of Use:** Operations will proceed only after confirming that this sequence of MCP tool consideration and utilization has been followed.
